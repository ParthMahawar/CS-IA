IB Computer Science internal assessment

The Raspberry Pi code is run on a RasPi connected to smoke and LPG sensors, which then sends it's data to the companion android app. If data values above a certain threshold are detected, the phone will keep receiving notifications. A camera module also takes a photo to allow the user to assess the situation.

The development summary document details this a bit more.
